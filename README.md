# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of CRUD using Django.  The website consists of a simple interface for a Student Record management system.
A new student can be created and added to the database, the record can be updated or deleted.  The records are displayed visually on the main admin interface with action buttons.

## User Experience - UX
I designed the interface to be instantly accesible and intuitive for the user experience. I use Font Awesome Icons for user actions which are recognisable.  The icons instantly convery the meaning of the action.  I use a Trashcan for the 'Delete' action and the user immediately undesrtands what this does without requiring any further training.

I feel this is a very important feature for the user experience and ensures the user experience is consistent with the user experience from other well known popular websites.

## Agile
I used www.trello.com to implement the agile approach.

## Epics and User Stories

#### Epic 1 The UI

#### User Relevance
* As a user I want the admin interface to be simple to use.  I want the action buttons to be visible.
* I want to be able to easily add a new record.
* I want to be able to update the record.
* I want to be able to delete the record when a student leaves.
